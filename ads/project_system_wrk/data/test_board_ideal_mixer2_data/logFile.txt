An HB truncation error may be present.
o The HB truncation error is due to using a finite order 
  (number of harmonics) in the representation of the
  circuit signals.

o Number of waveforms violating the HB truncation error check:
        3 out of 7 waveforms.
o Estimated max HB truncation error: 6.152e-05 @ waveform Vosc .
o The maximal HB truncation error estimate is greater than the 
  achieved tolerance of 1.160e-06 for this waveform.
o To reduce the error, increase the order (number of harmonics) 
  and re-simulate.
