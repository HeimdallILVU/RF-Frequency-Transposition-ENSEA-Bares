Warning detected by hpeesofsim in Substrate model during netlist flattening.
    Simulations referencing substrate `MSub1' will not include metal loss
    because metal thickness is zero.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 2

HB Env1[1] <project_system_lib:Frequency_Transposer_Transmission_Line:schematic>   time=(0 s->100 ns)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during HB analysis `Env1'.
    There are analysis frequencies inside Envelope bandwidths of other frequencies.
    A simpler frequency grid may be possible and faster.
