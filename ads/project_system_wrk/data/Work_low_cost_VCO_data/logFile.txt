An HB truncation error may be present.
o The HB truncation error is due to using a finite order 
  (number of harmonics) in the representation of the
  circuit signals.

o Number of waveforms violating the HB truncation error check:
        2 out of 5 waveforms.
o Estimated max HB truncation error: 8.064e-03 @ waveform N__8 .
o The maximal HB truncation error estimate is greater than the 
  achieved tolerance of 1.177e-06 for this waveform.
o A time-domain plot of the Vmod1 waveform may show the error as 
  Gibbs ripples.
o To reduce the error, increase the order (number of harmonics) 
  and re-simulate.
