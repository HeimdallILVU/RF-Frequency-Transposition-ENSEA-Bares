An HB truncation error may be present.
o The HB truncation error is due to using a finite order 
  (number of harmonics) in the representation of the
  circuit signals.

X1.X3.Vfiltered_VCO     4.204e-06       >       1.155e-06

o Number of waveforms violating the HB truncation error check:
        1 out of 16 waveforms.
o Estimated max HB truncation error: 4.204e-06 @ waveform X1.X3.Vfiltered_VCO .
o The maximal HB truncation error estimate is greater than the 
  achieved tolerance of 1.155e-06 for this waveform.
o A time-domain plot of the N__4 waveform may show the error as 
  Gibbs ripples.
o To reduce the error, increase the order (number of harmonics) 
  and re-simulate.
