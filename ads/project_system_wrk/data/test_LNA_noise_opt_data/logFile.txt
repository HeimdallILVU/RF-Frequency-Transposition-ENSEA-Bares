SP SP1[1] <project_system_lib:test_LNA_noise_opt:schematic>   freq=(500 MHz->1.2 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The global circuit temperature (25 C or 298.15 K) does not equal the
    IEEE standard noise temperature (16.85 C or 290 K) in the noise
    analysis `SP1'. As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio loss at the
    the circuit temperature and the noise figure, defined and calculated
    at the standard noise temperature, might not agree for a passive
    circuit. To eliminate this possible discrepancy, set the Temp parameter
    on the Options item to 16.85 C.
